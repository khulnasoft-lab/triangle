Description: geographical download redirector
 Mirrorbits is a geographical download redirector written in Go for
 distributing files efficiently across a set of mirrors. It offers a simple and
 economic way to create a Content Delivery Network layer using a pure software
 stack. It is primarily designed for the distribution of large-scale
 Open-Source projects with a lot of traffic.
 .
 Main Features:
  * Blazing fast, can reach 8K QPS on a single laptop
  * Easy to deploy and maintain, everything is packed in a single binary
  * Automatic synchronization with the mirrors over rsync or FTP
  * Response can be either JSON or HTTP redirect
  * Support partial repositories
  * Complete checksum / size control
  * Realtime monitoring and reports
  * Disable misbehaving mirrors without human intervention
  * Realtime decision making based on location, AS number and defined rules
  * Smart load-balancing over multiple mirrors in the same area to avoid
    hotspots
  * Ability to adjust the weight of each mirror
  * Limit access to a country, region or ASN for any mirror
  * Clustering (multiple mirrorbits instances)
  * High-availability using redis-sentinel
  * Automatically fix timezone offsets for broken mirrors
  * Realtime statistics per file / mirror / date
  * Realtime reconfiguration
  * Seamless binary upgrade (aka zero downtime upgrade)
  * Mirmon support
  * Full IPv6 support
