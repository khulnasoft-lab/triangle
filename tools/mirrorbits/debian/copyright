Comment:
 etix/goftp is a 2017 fork of jlaffaye/ftp with 10 additional commits. It adds
 various features and bug fixes.
 .
 youtube/vitess is now vitessio/vitess, around 500,000 lines of Go code.
 mirrorbits only needs a tiny part of it: vitess/go/cgzip. However this code
 was removed from vitess in 2019 anyway.  So packaging a recent version of
 vitessio/vitess won't help for this situation.  Another approach would be to
 replace it with NYTimes/gziphandler, which seems to fullfill the same need.
